class: class is a blueprint of an object it has properties, methods and blocks, etc...
object: object is an instance of a class(or a copy of class).

Data Hiding:
To avoid outside class cannot access our internal data Directly.
by using private modifier we can implement data hiding.

Abstraction in Java:
1. Hiding Internal implementation
2. must abstract class as abstract keyword.
3.cannot possible to instantiate (Object creation is not possible)
4. we can allowed to write both abstract and concrete methods(concrete methods nothing but method with body).
5.it has one zero parameter constructor.
6.allowed to declare both static and instance variables.
7. While using the abstract method in an abstract class mandatory to  declare an abstract keyword 
   whereas inside the interface abstract keyword JVM is added by default. 

Encapsulation In Java:
The binding of Data and Corresponding methods into a single Unit is called Encapsulation.
Encapsulation=Data Hiding+Abstraction.
We can achieve Encapsulation by using a private modifier and one pair of public setter and getter methods.
The advantage is security.

Inheritance(IS-A Relation):
Acquiring Properties from Parent to Child is called Inheritance.
It is also called an IS-A Relationship 
Using extends keyword we can implement the IS-A Relationship
The advantage is re-usability.
Types of Inheritance: 1. Single, 2. MultiLevel, 3. Hierarchical. 
java does not support multiple inheritance through classes to avoid ambiguity problems
but java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces.

HAS-A RELATIONSHIP:
1. also called as composition[Strong Association] 
   Example: University-Department
2. or aggregation[Weak Association] or Embedded one class with another class.
  Example: Department-Professor.
3. mostly implemented by using new Operator
4. The advantage of the HAS-A relationship is Reusability

Polymorphism in java:
The same name with different forms is the concept of Polymorphism 
Compile time: Overloading 
Runtime        : Overriding
flexibility
